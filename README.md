**AUX Smart Safety Kettle**

**Critique and Redesign of an Everyday Object**

This project is a redesign of the AUX electric water kettle, an everyday household appliance used for boiling water and cooking liquid foods such as soup or porridge. While it functions, it lacks feedback, safety, and clarity. This introduces sensor-based improvements to enhance usability, reduce risk, and support common multitasking scenarios without changing how users interact with the kettle.


**Redesign Concept: AUX Smart Safety Kettle**

The current gaps of the kettle directly affect user confidence and safety. These improvements matter because the kettle is used frequently, often while multitasking, and involves high temperatures.


**Conclusion**

The kettle demonstrates how small, well-considered sensor-based improvements can improve an everyday object. By addressing feedback, safety, and clarity gaps, the redesign improves the user experience while maintaining familiar interaction patterns and low social friction.
